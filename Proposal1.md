## Title of your project
Brake Your Bike

## Project goals
Aiming for:
1. Measure instantaneous speed of a bike.
2. Measure distance from bike to nearby objects (forward, side to side)

Safe Testing: We aim to fixate the bike through a repair stand with a clamp where wheels are still able to rotate and do the testing through moving the objects and humans toward it.

Stretch Goals:
Get a braking system to work. Here’s what we’re thinking:
1. Connecting servo motors to the braking cables
2. 3D model for attaching servo motors to the bike
3. Calibrating change in cable length to braking amount


Backup Project Plans:

Speed Displayer & Speed Limit Detection/Warning System
1. Have a speed display on the bike
2. Through gyroscope determine the location
3. Give sound/light warnings based on the adherence to the speed limit in the given location
4. Location’s speed limits will be mapped either manually or fetched from a (possibly? online) database

LEDs Synching with Speed of the Bike
1. Synching LEDs on the bike tyre with its speed 
2. Displaying patterns on the wheels of the bike


## Resources, budget
1. Sensor to measure speed
2. Ultrasound sensor
3. Motor to push brake (will look into later)

Want to talk about which sensors are best at Friday OH.


## Tasks, member responsibilities
Planning to work on each part together. Loosely, Eylül will take the lead on speed and Ansh will take the lead on distance.

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
Worst case scenario timeline:
Measure speed — Wednesday, December 4th
Measure distance — Monday, December 10th
For all the other things — December 12th


## Additional resources, issues
We want to know what kind of sensor would be best to measure speed and what kind of ultrasound sensor would work best.
